For me the best part of developing software is learning problem domains. My career began working on accounting, invoicing and inventory control systems for medium sized businesses primarily in West Michigan. We served trucking companies, tool & die makers, laundry, paint stores, and many others. Along the way computers became networked and personal. I learned networks, object oriented design and distributed systems. * My career has trended up, crashed and crawled back up. My first title was computer programmer. Back then programming a computer was a big deal. To a certain extent it still is. I have the knack. Software developers know what that knack is, but we are at a loss to explain what it is. I worked at Osterbaan Consultants (my Dad's company) for 17 years. I left to work for our then largest customer in 1999. After Y2K and converting to an outsourced computer system I was laid off. I was unemployed for a period then under employed. I worked as a carpenter. There I learned two key lessons. There are many honorable trades with highly skilled people doing them. There are about 3 perfect weather days a year in Michigan to work outside. I worked on a siding crew. The intense intentional teamwork environment there impresses me to this day. I worked as an apprentice electrician for a year. I focused on installing Motorola Canopy family of high speed internet equipment because I had previous networking experience. I was also trained in new residential, commercial, and remodeling electrical work. Finally I was hired in at Smith's Aerospace (later acquired by GE) as a lab specialist. I finished my Master's degree and eventually moved up to a software developer role. Here I've learned software engineering and aerospace quality."

Thanks to that mindset, I was able to get through college successfully, as well as progress as a person and a programmer. My interest in software engineering first began during my high school days. I loved learning about the newest technology in cellphones during the time, whether it be related to hardware or software. This encouraged me to major in Electrical & Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. During my four years at UT Austin, I gained a great amount of experience while working on various types of projects— such as a mini video game and an information database website. My personal favorite was a 2-semester long Capstone Design project where 5 students and I worked together to build a pair of gloves that would translate American Sign Language in real-time. Throughout the course, we brainstormed what type of sensors would be needed, researched existing patents/projects to gather more ideas and ensure we were not copying them, built and tested the glove & website, and finished off by successfully demoing the project. Many people choose to focus on their positive experiences, but I feel that it is important to give attention to the negative parts as well. I dealt with failures throughout the four years, which also slowed down my progress a couple of times. I took on this challenge of getting myself back on track and worked hard to get myself to where I am today. I keep a determined mindset with everything I do and stay positive even during the toughest problems. Since I have graduated from college, I have not stopped educating myself and improving my existing skills. I truly believe that, no matter what stage in life I'm currently in, I'm always learning something new. Now that I've joined General Motors as a Software Developer, I look forward to being able to work on new projects, expose myself to different technology, and learn from my peers!"

My earliest contacts with computers was way back in 1986 when I had Commodore 64. Later, I acquired Amiga 500, but my first real programming experiences happened when I acquired my first PC in the nineties. At that time, I used Modula2, Delphi, BDE, Interbase. I preferred working in Delphi (I consider it a great IDE for Visual Pascal) but as the time passed it was gradually replaced with C#, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, MYSQL and PHP so, I had to evolve with the times. Today, my personal favorites are CakePHP, Bootstrap and MySQL. I am experienced in this fields and have done many projects using them. (Full list of my projects is available in the bottom part of this page, bellow this overview) All I can say after more than three decades of working with computers is that I am not tired of them.

"Michael Hayworth", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeldhayworth", "Society of Software Developers", "Society of Software Developers", "institute_name: University of Florida - degree: Bachelor of Science - BS Computer Science", "I was this close to being a music teacher instead of a software developer. These fields may seem like polar opposites, but they have some similarities. I always heard in my music classes that good composers followed the rules, while the great composers were willing to try new things. The same holds true for programming: I am always searching to for a new solution or angle to approach a problem and never accepting that my code is "as good as it can be." I like to use a logical approach to solve my problems, so I set up a simple algorithm in my mind to help me think through what I really want. int musicTeacher = 0; int softwareDeveloper = 0; input: I know that I enjoy seeking new solutions and discussing with my peers how to solve complex problems. softwareDeveloper++; input: I am creative and enjoy teaching others. musicTeacher++: input: I could be a software developer and still enjoy playing and teaching music as a hobby. softwareDeveloper++; My algorithm gave me an answer: I can pursue software development professionally, while still enjoying the creative aspect of music to keep my mind sharp. In my time working towards my computer science degree, I have accumulated skills including proficiency in C++, Java, and Python, experience in collaborative projects with Git/GitHub, and product management in an agile environment. I have learned these skills through exceptional teachers, individual research, and time with my peers in the Society of Software Developers. My passions within my field include object-oriented programming, agile software development, product management, and a mathematical approach to problem-solving. I am in search of an internship opportunity where I can continue to grow as a software engineer and learn from industry professionals about the code behind real life software people use every day. At the end of the day, I like to spend my time playing/listening to music (I play woodwind instruments) and spending time with my family outdoors."

I was born in Kazakhstan, where I live at the moment. Here are few things about me: 1) My current programming languages of choice are Rust and Go. I enjoy writing highly efficient and safe code that uses elegant algorithms and architecture. In past, I have worked with many different languages, including FORTRAN for computational physics and Python for general purpose programming. Nowadays, I use Go for back-end development and Rust for systems development. Both of these languages are fast and versatile. They also require a challenging thinking model, which I find appealing. 2) I can apply base principles and systematic approach for problem solving. As a Physics major I have developed problem solving skills that can be applied to any field. Physics taught me to dissect any big question into smaller, digestible problems, and then apply fundamental knowledge to solve  them. 3) I strongly believe that communication is the key. I have lead a small team of aspiring software developers to create and deploy commercial IT projects. It is how I learned the importance of communication. 4) Multilingual. I am fluent in English, Russian and Kazakh. 5) Math Skills. I am proficient with math as a result of my Physics training. I can solve multivariable calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, complex analysis and statistics problems. But more importantly, I know how to transform a real-life problem into a set of mathematical equations, which I can solve using above-mentioned math skills. 6) I am inventor at heart. Despite my natural science background, I am inclined towards creative processes. Whether it is programming, physics or everyday tasks, I relish in discovering non-conventional approaches and solutions."

The use of Test Driven Development (TDD) gives us assurance that any changes we make do not break existing business rules and our software continues to grow with the business. However, the use of TDD is only effective if we have good coverage. How do we ensure that this is achieved throughout the team?. The use of Continous integrations tools like jenkins and sonar give visual metrics on coverage and adherence to standards. How do we make sure that teams are adhering to SOLID OO Principles?. Peer review and practices like pairing help in distributing knowledge in the team. How do we make sure that the more experienced developers are passing knowledge to the less experienced developers?. Again practices like pairing, peer review and formal mentoring help in bringing the less experienced developers up to speed. Do actively managed teams perform better than self managing teams?. Software development is a creative field and everybody in a team should have a voice, let the team leader be a mediator instead of a manager. Be a manager only when really necessary. Create ownership in the team. Every software project is a work of art, the only difference is that it is alive and contines to grow with time. I have been in the software development field professionally since end of 2005. In this time I have had the opportunity to use practices and tools I have mentioned above and become a big champion of them.
